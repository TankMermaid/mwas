To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.','Human gut microbiome differentiation viewed across cultures, ages and families'],'USchp25Mom.418780': ['USchp25Mom.418780','GTAGCGCGAGTT','CCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT','34','ADULT','UBERON:feces','GAZ:United States of America','39','PMID: 20534432; samples were amplified with a total of 96 barcoded primers; 14 pools were constructed and sequenced using HiSeq illumina paired end','Mother','human','39.95234','-75.164','FWD:TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC;REV:GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT','11','565','CGS-GL','8/1/11','Run_565_lane_1','female','Gut microbial communities represent one source of human genetic and metabolic diversity.

To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.','Human gut microbiome differentiation viewed across cultures, ages and families'],'h305M.1.418771': ['h305M.1.418771','TACTTCGCTCGC','CCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT','23','ADULT','UBERON:feces','GAZ:Malawi','2564','PMID: 20534432; samples were amplified with a total of 96 barcoded primers; 14 pools were constructed and sequenced using HiSeq illumina paired end','Mother','human','-15.3','35.4','FWD:TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC;REV:GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT','12','565','CGS-GL','8/1/11','Run_565_lane_2','female','Gut microbial communities represent one source of human genetic and metabolic diversity.

        <p id="explanation"><strong>Chrome:</strong> Type "chrome://flags/" into the address bar, then search for "Disable WebGL". Disable this option if you haven't already. <em>Note:</em> If you follow these steps and still don't see an image, go to "chrome://flags/" and then search for "Override software rendering list" and enable this option.</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Safari:</strong> Open Safari's menu and select Preferences. Click on the advanced tab, and then check "Show Developer" menu. Then open the "Developer" menu and select "Enable WebGL".</p>
        <p id="explanation"><strong>Firefox:</strong> Go to Options through Firefox > Options or Tools > Options. Go to Advanced, then General. Check "Use hardware acceleration when available" and restart Firefox.</p>
